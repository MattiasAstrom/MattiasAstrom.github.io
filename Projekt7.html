                            For this project, my primary responsibility was to develop a character controller for a
                            first-person shooter game. As part of the group, we were required to use the PhysX API for
                            the game. This meant that I had to learn how to implement the API effectively.
                        <p>

                            Using the PhysX API, I developed a character controller that allowed for smooth and
                            realistic movement within the game. This was crucial for creating an immersive experience
                            for the player. The API allowed me to handle player movement and interactions with the
                            environment in a way that felt natural and intuitive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also worked closely with the level designers and artists to ensure that the character
                            controller fit seamlessly into the game's overall design. We wanted to create a game that
                            was visually stunning and engaging, and the character controller played a critical role in
                            achieving that goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, my main responsibility for this project was to develop a character controller that
                            was responsive, realistic, and easy to use. Through the use of the PhysX API and close
                            collaboration with the team, I believe that we were able to achieve this goal and create a
                            memorable gaming experience for our players.

                        <p>
                            In terms of weapons, I implemented a system that allowed for weapon upgrades. The first
                            upgrade initially increased the weapon's range, but due to a lack of visual feedback for the
                            player, I changed it to a damage increase instead.
                        </p>

                                height="300"></video>
                        </span>
                        
                        <p>
                            The second upgrade introduced a stasis
                            effect that allowed players to freeze moving platforms, which the Level Designer could
                            select as interactable objects. This added an extra layer of interactivity and strategy to
                            the game.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The third upgrade was a multishot feature that allowed players to enter a "locked
                            in" mode where they could fire at enemies to lock onto them. At the end of the mode, any hit
                            enemies, buttons, platforms, or other types of objects took damage or were activated. This
                            added a new dynamic to the game's combat system and made it more engaging for the player.
